Instructions

 • Only this page will serve as reference: do not trust rumors.

 • Watch out! This document could potentially change up before submission.

 • Make sure you have the appropriate permissions on your files and directories.

 • You have to follow the submission procedures for all your exercises.

 • Your exercises will be checked and graded by your fellow classmates.

 • On top of that, your exercises will be checked and graded by a program called
   Moulinette.

 • Moulinette is very meticulous and strict in its evaluation of your work. It is entirely
   automated and there is no way to negotiate with it. So if you want to avoid bad
   surprises, be as thorough as possible.

 • Moulinette is not very open-minded. It won’t try and understand your code if it
   doesn’t respect the Norm. Moulinette relies on a program called norminette to
   check if your files respect the norm. TL;DR: it would be idiotic to submit a piece
   of work that doesn’t pass norminette’s check.

 • These exercises are carefully laid out by order of difficulty - from easiest to hardest.
   We will not take into account a successfully completed harder exercise if an easier
   one is not perfectly functional.

 • Using a forbidden function is considered cheating. Cheaters get -42, and this grade
   is non-negotiable.

 • You’ll only have to submit a main() function if we ask for a program.

 • Moulinette compiles with these flags: -Wall -Wextra -Werror, and uses gcc.

 • If your program doesn’t compile, you’ll get 0.

 • You cannot leave any additional file in your directory than those specified in the
   subject.

 • Got a question? Ask your peer on the right. Otherwise, try your peer on the left.

   • Your reference guide is called Google / man / the Internet / ....

   • Check out the "C Piscine" part of the forum on the intranet, or the slack Piscine.

   • Examine the examples thoroughly. They could very well call for details that are
     not explicitly mentioned in the subject...

   • By Odin, by Thor ! Use your brain !!!




             Norminette must be launched with the -R CheckForbiddenSourceHeader
             flag. Moulinette will use it too.

Foreword

Vincent: And you know what they call a... a... a Quarter Pounder with Cheese
in Paris?

Jules: They don’t call it a Quarter Pounder with cheese?

Vincent: No man, they got the metric system. They wouldn’t know what the fuck
a Quarter Pounder is.

Jules: Then what do they call it?

Vincent: They call it a Royale with cheese.

Jules: A Royale with cheese. What do they call a Big Mac?

Vincent: Well, a Big Mac’s a Big Mac, but they call it le Big-Mac.

Jules: Le Big-Mac. Ha ha ha ha. What do they call a Whopper?

Vincent: I dunno, I didn’t go into Burger King.

  At least one of the following exercices has nothing to do you with a Royale with cheese.
